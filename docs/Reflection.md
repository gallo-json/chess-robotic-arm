# Reflection

Challenging project. Needed to learn a bit of Arduino C/C++. Lots of precise diagrams and angles and using trigonomtery to find the exact angles the arm needed to move. Problems arose, like the arm would move too low and not pick up the piece. Another problem was the fact that the trigonometry was wrong, or too many numbers to compute; values were rounded off prematurely and the final angles were off. The code itself is a bit rough but it works.

## What did I learn?

- More Arduino C/C++
- Serial TTL interfacing
- Trignonometry & basic inverse kinematics
